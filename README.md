# ODE model for streamer heads

This code implements the streamer head ODE model described in the paper [Macroscopic parameterization of positive streamer heads in air](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04282), written by Bouwman, Ebert & Teunissen.

This version of the code is a re-implementation by Jannis Teunissen of the original code written by Dennis Bouwman during his PhD at CWI, Amsterdam.

# Usage

    # To see all the options
    ./ODE_model.py -h

    # To run the code with the default parameters and make a plot:
    ./ODE_model.py -plot
